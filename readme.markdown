# SkyNet

## About

SkyNet is a C# client for the Microsoft SkyDrive service through its RESTful API.  Its focus is currently on access to and modification of user resources -- documents, files, etc. -- and not manipulation of albums or social features such as tags and comments.

Microsoft has released the [Live SDK](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/live/ff621310 "Microsoft Live SDK"), a set of C# libraries for interacting with SkyDrive, but use of these are limited to Metro and Windows Phone apps.  SkyNet was developed in response to the lack of support for server and desktop applications.
