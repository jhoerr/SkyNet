SkyNet
======

SkyDrive is accessible through the Live SDK, but use of this SDK this is limited to Metro and Windows Phone apps. SkyNet is a client library for the SkyDrive REST API that supports (or will support) the OAuth2 authentication flow and standard file I/O operations.  The intent is to fill the non-Metro client-side gap.

SkyNet is (liberally) inspired by dkarzon/DropNet.
